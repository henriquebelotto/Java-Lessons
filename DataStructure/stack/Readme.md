# Stack

A Stack data structure follows the **"Last-In-First-Out"** methodology, i.e., the last
element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack

This class use an **Object Adapter** Design pattern to implement a Stack by wrapping a Doubly Linked List object
inside the Stack constructor. Also, all the Stack methods, such as push and pop, are implemented
using the methods already implemented in the doubly linked list
